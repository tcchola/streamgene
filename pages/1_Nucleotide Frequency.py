            Nucleotides are organic molecules composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar and a phosphate. 
            They serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers â€“ deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic 
            acid (RNA), both of which are essential biomolecules within all life-forms on Earth. Nucleotides are obtained 
            in the diet and are also synthesized from common nutrients by the liver.
