    st.info("""
                In molecular biology and genetics, GC-content (or guanine-cytosine content) is the percentage of
                nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C). This
                measure indicates the proportion of G and C bases out of an implied four total bases, also including
                adenine and thymine in DNA and adenine and uracil in RNA. GC-content may be given for a certain fragment
                of DNA or RNA or for an entire genome. When it refers to a fragment, it may denote the GC-content of an
                individual gene or section of a gene (domain), a group of genes or gene clusters, a non-coding region,
                or a synthetic oligonucleotide such as a primer.

    st.info("""
            In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, the GC-content of short oligonucleotides known as primers
            is often used to predict their annealing temperature to the template DNA. A higher GC-content level indicates
            a relatively higher melting temperature. Many sequencing technologies, such as Illumina sequencing, have trouble
            reading high-GC-content sequences. Bird genomes are known to have many such parts, causing the problem of
            "missing genes" expected to be present from evolution and phenotype but never sequenced ‚Äî until improved methods were used.

    st.info("""
            The species problem in non-eukaryotic taxonomy has led to various suggestions in classifying bacteria, and the
            ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics of 1987 has recommended use of GC-ratios
            in higher-level hierarchical classification. For example, the Actinomycetota are characterised as "high GC-content
            bacteria". In Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), GC-content is 72%. With the use of more reliable, modern methods of
            molecular systematics, the GC-content definition of Actinomycetota has been abolished and low-GC bacteria of this clade have been found.
